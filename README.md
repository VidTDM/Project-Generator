It's bit different because of different terminals.

**_Note:_** _It generates a folder with the name you gave, not only the files_

---

## Flags

- `--none`

  `--none` is usefull when you want to generate a basic project with only html

- `--all`

  `--all` is usefull when you want to generate a project with all files

**_Note:_** _When you don't give it a name it defaults to project._

## What's Next?

Able to generate different types of projects like `CLI`, `Discord Bot` etc.

I told that I would add languages like `haml`, `coffescript` and `postCSS` but I didn't because those languages are kind of dead :skull:
