It's bit different because of different terminals.

**_Note:_** _It generates a folder with the name you gave, not only the files_

---

## Flags

- `--css`

  `--css` is for saying yes to having css in your project

- `--js`

  `--js` is for saying yes to having js in your project

- `--yes`

  `--yes` is useful when you want to generate basic project with only html

### Here's list of all the Flags

- `--css`
- `--js`
- `--yes`

**_Note:_** _When you don't give it a name it defaults to project._

----------

## What's Next?

I am probably going to add a `--all` flag which will generate a project with all files.

Also I may add the ability to add preproccesors like `sass`, `pug`, `less`, `haml`, `typescript`, `coffescript`
